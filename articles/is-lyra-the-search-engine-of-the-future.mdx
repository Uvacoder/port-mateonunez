## Lyra? The constellation?

It's been a while since I've written an article. I've been working a lot in a few projects, and I've been learning a lot of new things.

The first time I heard about Lyra was in a LinkedIn post made by [Michele Riva](https://twitter.com/MicheleRivaCode). He posted a video showing a new search engine written in TypeScript. I was amazed because Lyra found **thousands** results within a few **microseconds** (_Î¼s_). I was like "WTF?". I was so curious about this project that I decided to take a look at the code.

This is how I felt:

I found:

- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- JavaScript

It was like a treasure hunt. I was so excited that I decided to contribute to the project. I started by adding a few tests and small some bugs. Each contribution I made help me to learn more about the project, about OSS contributions and it gives me the opportunity to learn more about Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Let's try it!

As I told you Lyra is made to run wherever JavaScript runs. And this blog is made with **JavaScript**. So I've created a new component using the superpower of the [MDX](/blog/hello-blog) to show the results of a search.
